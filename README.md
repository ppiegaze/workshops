# Union OSS Workshops

## Introduction
This repository contains a series of Flyte Workshops that are designed for more advanced users.
These workshops each have their own readme, and dependencies; **All workshops assume you have an operating Flyte Cluster**.

All workshops which utilize github actions for CI/CD have their own separate action stored in .github/workflows.
